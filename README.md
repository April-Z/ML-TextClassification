# ML-TextClassification
Machine Learning Homework probelm 
3. (4 + 1 pts) Text classification. Download the Enron-spam dataset from http://www.aueb.gr/users/ion/data/enron-spam/. Use the pre-processed datasets Enron1, . . . , Enron5 as training data and Enron6 as test data. Implement the Naive Bayes algorithm that we discussed in the class (one reference is http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/13bayes.pdf), or become familiar with a tool (like that provided by scikit- learn) and use that. Remember to perform all calculations on the log scale to prevent underflow. For the base question (4 pts)
